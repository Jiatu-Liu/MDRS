# Multi_Modal
notes:

1, install gsas2 in your user path (by default) and install larch in your python environment
2, put Main.py, Classes.py and draggablewidget_new.py (modified from Akihito Takeuchi's draggabletabwidget.py) in the same folder
3, install azint by conda install -c maxiv azint (this step is not necessary if you do not integrate locally)
4, run Main.py
